# Ludo Game

The Ludo game displayed in the TonPlaygram web app is loaded from the open source project [`Ludo-Built-With-React`](https://github.com/eze4acme/Ludo-Built-With-React).

As of June 2025 that repository does **not** include a license file. In the absence of a published license the code should be considered "all rights reserved" by the author. You may view and play the game through its public site, but you should not redistribute or reuse the code without obtaining permission from the original author.

This directory exists to document the source of the game and does not contain the actual game assets.

If `https://eze4acme.github.io/Ludo-Built-With-React/` returns a 404 you will
need to host your own build of that repository. Clone the project, run `npm
install && npm run build`, upload the `dist` folder to a static host and update
`src/pages/Games/LudoGame.jsx` with your hosted URL.
